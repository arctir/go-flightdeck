# go-flightdeck

Go bindings for the [Flightdeck API Specification](https://github.com/arctir/flightdeck-api).

### Generation

This package is largely auto-generated. It is built on a trigger from the [API repository](https://github.com/arctir/flightdeck-api). These binding will be built for every versioned tag pushed to the API repository. 

In addition to the generated code, there are methods to make client authentication a bit easier.
